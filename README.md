# Small project for learning web scraping with puppeteer

## Scraping Amazon

Started off project by scraping amazon and determining whether a product is on sale. If the product is on sale, it returns a list price along with the actual price. If the product isn't on sale, it returns just the actual price. In both cases the title is also returned.

## Avoiding Detection

Followed the article [It is _not_ possible to detect and block chrome headless](https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/) which walks through avoiding detection on a headless chrome browser with puppeteer. Was able to pass the test cases provided in [this link](https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/chrome-headless-test.html) based on the article.
